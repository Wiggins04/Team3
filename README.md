Source Code
To run the code, it's recommended to use Visual Studio Code. You will also need to install the following libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, mplcursors and numpy. This is done by inputting 'pip install pandas' for example, into the VS code console. Once the code has ran, a Menu system will appear in the console. Proceed by selecting one of the desired options to run it's associated algorithm. Each individual algorithm may be viewed seperately in the persons respective GitHub branch, and the code in full can be accessed via the 'main' branch called 'source code'. Each algorithm will require the user to input at least a start year from between the years 1993-2021. Most will also ask the user to input an end year and will result in a graph being created showing its respective data anaysis. Input validation for each algorithm is included.

 to run this code it is the same as the source use visual studio with anaconda download additional modules and the code should run with a python interpreter

 To run my algorithm, select option 4 from the Menu labelled 'Gia filter effect'. The libaries pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and numpy are required for this visualisation. User inputs are validated to reduce errors ask you will be asked to input a start and an end year between 1993-2021. A box plot graph will be outputted - for help reading this type of graph visit: https://www.atlassian.com/data/charts/box-plot-complete-guide#:~:text=Interpreting%20a%20box%20and%20whiskers&text=The%20first%20quartile%20(Q1)%20is,smaller%20than%20the%20remaining%2025%25.

Before trying to run my algorithm it is imperative to use Visual Studio and install the following libraries/modules: pandas, matplotlib, , numpy, scipy, and mplcursors. Once those are installed, from the menu select option 3. From there you will be asked to enter a start and an end year between 1993-2021. The user input is validated to minimise errors, ensuring that the user does not enter anything outside of the dataset. 4 graphs will then appear showing a line of best fit for each.
