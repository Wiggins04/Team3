Source Code
To run the code, it's recommended to use Visual Studio Code. You will also need to install the following libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, mplcursors and numpy. This is done by inputting 'pip install pandas' for example, into the VS code console. Once the code has ran, a Menu system will appear in the console. Proceed by selecting one of the desired options to run it's associated algorithm. Each individual algorithm may be viewed seperately in the persons respective GitHub branch, and the code in full can be accessed via the 'main' branch called 'source code'. Each algorithm will require the user to input at least a start year from between the years 1993-2021. Most will also ask the user to input an end year and will result in a graph being created showing its respective data anaysis. Input validation for each algorithm is included.

 to run this code it is the same as the source use visual studio with anaconda download additional modules and the code should run with a python interpreter

 To run my algorithm, select option 4 from the Menu labelled 'Gia filter effect'. The libaries pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and numpy are required for this visualisation. User inputs are validated to reduce errors ask you will be asked to input a start and an end year between 1993-2021. A box plot graph will be outputted - for help reading this type of graph visit: https://www.atlassian.com/data/charts/box-plot-complete-guide#:~:text=Interpreting%20a%20box%20and%20whiskers&text=The%20first%20quartile%20(Q1)%20is,smaller%20than%20the%20remaining%2025%25.

Before trying to run my algorithm it is imperative to use Visual Studio and install the following libraries/modules: pandas, matplotlib, , numpy, scipy, and mplcursors. Once those are installed, from the menu select option 3. From there you will be asked to enter a start and an end year between 1993-2021. The user input is validated to minimise errors, ensuring that the user does not enter anything outside of the dataset. 4 graphs will then appear showing a line of best fit for each.

 Before running my algorithm (which is option 1) install the following modules: pandas, matplotlib, , numpy, scipy, seaborn and mplcursors. Once those are installed and the program has been run, from the menu select option 1. From there you will be asked to enter 1993-2021. The user input is validated to minimise errors, ensuring that the user does not enter anything outside of the dataset. one graph will appear as well as the calculation of the average in the teminal.

 To run my algorithm which is option 2, you will need to install pandas, matplotlib, numpy, scipy, seaborn and mplcursors. The operation starts on the main menu, where you would select option 2, this would then ask you to input a start year, then the end year. After inputting this info, there will be two graphs, one with GIA and the other without GIA. If the user inputs an incorrect date, they will be given an error message and will be asked if they want to search for other dates instead. Once the program has run, the user is asked to either search other dates, or go back to the main menu.


 

Thomas-Coffey- algorithm with specific year/ range functionality and graph: Ensure Python and Visual Studio are installed, and install the required libraries(pandas, matplotlib, numpy, scipy, mplcursors) After running the code, you'll be prompted to choose between viewing a graph or inputting a specific year or range. If you select the graph option, a plot showing the sea level change over time will be displayed. If you choose to input a year or range, you'll be asked to input a specific/range of years, and the program will calculate and display the average sea level change accordingly.
